The main goal of the project is to study the operation of Unix signals for messaging. </br>

You need to write two small programs: a client and a server.</br>
The client sends a message to the server, and the server receives it using signals in binary form and converts it into text.</br>

In the bonus part it is necessary that the server can accept not only ascii characters, but also Unicode. </br>
